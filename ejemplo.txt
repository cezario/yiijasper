Suppose you have report with a query like that:

select * from students where group = $P{group}

And you want to show, all students in the group B:

$re = new JasperReport('/reports/students', JasperReport::FORMAT_HTML, array(
            'group' => 'B',
        ));
$re->exec();
$html = $re->toHTML();;
 
$this->render('groups', array(
    'html' => $html,
));

JasperReport::FORMAT_HTML is the initial format, you can export later if is necesary.

Here you show a widget with students in group C:

$this->widget('JReportView', array(
    'pathReport'=>'/reports/students',
    'params' => array(
        'group' => 'C',
    )
));
